# Lepbase fork of SequenceServer

To use sequenceserver in your own site visit the official project at http://www.sequenceserver.com.

This repository is forked from an older version of sequenceserver and has become difficult to install.  It is being maintained as part of [Lepbase](http://lepbase.org) as it has some useful features for integation with our Ensembl site and for database display/selection that we hope to see implemented in the official repository.
